# Mini-Waste-to-Energy-Sim

**Logline**: This project sims daily biogas energy output from organic waste using python code.

**Overview**: I created a Python project which calculates how much energy can be made from organic waste. The amount of waste, how much biogas it produces, and how much energy is in the biogas are used to showcase the output. The output is displayed in text, as well as in a bar chart for daily energy conversion and a line graph for cumulative energy over time with different efficiencies. 

**Key Values Used**: 
            - Daily waste: 50-75kg 
            - Biogas produced: 0.5 m^3 per kg of waste
            - Energy per m^3 of biogas: 6 kwh 
            - Efficiencies: 75%, 85%, 95%

**Features**: 
            - Showcases energy produces in multiple ways. 
            - Compares different efficiencies. 
            - Color-coded chart 
            - Provides summaries.
